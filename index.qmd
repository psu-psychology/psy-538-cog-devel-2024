## Agenda

- Wherefore perception?
- Case study: The development of motion perception
- Discussion of

  - [@Newell1973-ic]
  
# Wherefore perception?

## What must animals do?

## Behavioral priorities

- Secure sustenance (food & drink)...
- Avoid harm
- (Maybe, just maybe...) reproduce

## Behavioral primitives

- Locomotion (wayfinding, steering, & balance)
- Object interaction/manipulation
- Communication (vocalizing & gesturing)

## Perception informs...

- Where things are; where they're moving
- Who/what's out there
- Where am I positioned/moving
- What should I do next

## *Extero*ception ($E$) provides information about...

- Geometry and motion of objects and surfaces
- Surface properties (color, texture, rigidity)
- Object properties
  - animate/inanimate; familiar/un-; person/animal...; threat/not-, etc.

## *Intero*ception ($I$) provides information about...

- Current states (of body, and thoughts, emotions, plans)
- Past states (a.k.a., memories)
- $E+I = P$

### Psychophysics

- Maps perception (*psycho*) to *physic*al features
- Among the earliest ([Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Heinrich_Weber) & [Fechner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Fechner)) methods in experimental psychology

## Rates of visual development

- Vary across visual functions
- Some (e.g., motion perception) not mature until adolescence.

## Implications?

## Motor development

> "*For me, one of the major attractions of visual science is the promise it holds for empirical attacks on the mind-body problem...*"

:::

::::

---

>"*...that is, for working out meaningful ways to explain psychophysically defined visual functions on the basis of properties of the neural substrate....*"

>*...A critical locus or critical computation for a particular perceptual function can be defined as an anatomic or computational stage at which information concerning that function is lost or importantly reorganized...*"

---

>"*or more poetically, as a stage or computation that leaves its mark on that perceptual capacity.*"

>"*Part of the appeal of visual development is its potential for extending this promise. **Visual functions mature because the visual substrate matures**, and the causes of functional maturation undoubtedly lie in neural maturation.*"

---

>"*But the length of the big toe matures too, and we do not see it as causal in relation to the development of grating acuity. The puzzle is, **which of the many immaturities of the visual substrate provide the critical immaturities** that limit a particular visual capacity at a particular age?*"

- Visual motion generated by observer movement

## Findings

---

- Infant (passengers) experience faster visual speeds than mother
- Controlling for speed of locomotion, environment
- Motion "priors" for infants â‰  mothers
- Infants experience very fast visual speeds, but large individual differences

Eleanor Jack Gibson</br>
1922-2002

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Developmental psychologist
- Co-founder (with J.J. Gibson) of the ecological approach to psychology

:::

::::

## Has psychology a future?

- Yes, if...
- No, if...

---

>"*I consider that psychologists have a duty to explore their own field, to create hypotheses about the behavior of animals, especially human, and to test these and look for possible causal relationships at the level of acting, thinking, perceiving humans in their environmental context.*"

---

>"*Our agenda should be at this level, not one that depends all waiting for reductionist theories at some other level, be it neural, genetic, nuclear, or especially artificial.*"

>"*To go about this work, a developmental approach, in a systems setting-the organism-environment system-holds great promise...*"

---

>"*The concept of mechanism is one of the consequences of dualistic thinking.*"

>"*I have been deeply distressed in recent years by people who refer to certain achievements of infancy as "innate," and then drop the problem as if it were solved. This is a futile, evasive tactic.*"

>"*...we gain our understanding from change and becoming.*"

## Hallmarks of human behavior

- *Agency* (the self in control)
- *Prospectivity* (the forward-looking character of behavior)
- *Flexibility* (transferability of means)
- *Communicative creativity* (multiplication of means of communicating)
- *Restrospectivity* (the backward-looking character of behavior)

### Gibson argues that a developmental approach is essential to psychological research. What arguments might you make to persuade a skeptical non-developmentalist that this is so?

## You can't play 20 questions with nature and win

- Why not?

---

>"*We never seem in the experimental literature to put the results of all the experiments together.*"

---

### Is Newell right that psychological research seems to focus on binary opposites? Why or why not? What domains of research in cognitive development support your position?

# Summing up

## Perception

- Develops across childhood
- Physical development changes experienced visual input
- But cultural may not change motion input (very much)

## Gibson & Newell

- What should (developmental, cognitive) psychologists focus on?
  - Complex behaviors
  - Integration of evidence across studies
  - More thorough understanding of complete (real-world) tasks
- Avoid binary opposites!
