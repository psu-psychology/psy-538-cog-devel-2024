## Agenda

- Wherefore perception?
- Discussion of
  - Gilmore et al.
  - Gibson
  - Newell
  
# Wherefore perception?

## What must animals do?

## Behavioral priorities

- Secure sustenance (food & drink)...
- Avoid harm
- (Maybe, just maybe...) reproduce

## Behavioral primitives

- Locomotion (wayfinding, steering, & balance)
- Object interaction/manipulation
- Communication (vocalizing & gesturing)

## Perception informs...

- Where things are; where they're moving
- Who/what's out there
- Where am I positioned/moving
- What should I do next

## *Extero*ception ($E$) provides information about...

- Geometry and motion of objects and surfaces
- Surface properties (color, texture, rigidity)
- Object properties
  - animate/inanimate; familiar/un-; person/animal...; threat/not-, etc.

## *Intero*ception ($I$) provides information about...

- Current states (of body, and thoughts, emotions, plans)
- Past states (a.k.a., memories)
- $E+I = P$

## Measuring perception

### Psychophysics

- Maps perception (*psycho*) to *physic*al features
- Among the earliest ([Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Heinrich_Weber) & [Fechner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Fechner)) methods in experimental psychology

## Rates of visual development

- Vary across visual functions

## Rates of visual development

- Some (e.g., motion perception) not mature until adolescence.

## Implications?

## Motor development

> "For me, one of the major attractions of visual science is the **promise it holds for empirical attacks on the mind-body problem**..."

:::

::::

---

> "...that is, for working out meaningful ways to explain psychophysically defined visual functions on the basis of properties of the neural substrate....

---

>...A critical locus or critical computation for a particular perceptual function can be defined as an anatomic or computational stage at which information concerning that function is lost or importantly reorganized..."

---

> "or more poetically, as a stage or computation that leaves its mark on that perceptual capacity."

---

> "Part of the appeal of visual development is its potential for extending this promise. **Visual functions mature because the visual substrate matures**, and the causes of functional maturation undoubtedly lie in neural maturation."

---

> "But the length of the big toe matures too, and we do not see it as causal in relation to the development of grating acuity. The puzzle is, **which of the many immaturities of the visual substrate provide the critical immaturities** that limit a particular visual capacity at a particular age?"

## Findings

![[@Raudies2014-tg]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilmore-lab/temple-2017-02-27/master/img/optic-flow-locomotion.jpg)

---

- Infant (passengers) experience faster visual speeds than mother
- Controlling for speed of locomotion, environment
- Motion "priors" for infants â‰  mothers

## Implications

- If perception is changing across childhood...
- What does that mean for cognition?

# Gibson

# Newell

# Summing up

## Perception

- Develops across childhood
- Physical development changes experienced visual input
- But culture does not change motion input

## Gibson & Newell

- What should (developmental, cognitive) psychologists focus on?
